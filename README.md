MG- I have left out styling of the app and more advanced functionality until I get the code cleaned up.  

* Looking at it, I think its a mess.  
* Views seem to have too much in regards to hard-coded values and routes file seems to have too much code.  
* Not sure what the best method for organizing the code is.  
* I found it weird that I couldn't use haml in the helpers, but the only thing I could get to work was html.  Am I properly using helpers?
* I really am the greatest of amateur hacks, so any advice/criticism will be readily accepted.
* App is sitting on [Heroku](http://boardgamegeek.herokuapp.com).
